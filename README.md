My Utilities for Blender

## Color Scheme addon for Blender
The color scheme addon is based on [Agave 0.4.7](https://web.archive.org/web/20170327063642/http://home.gna.org/colorscheme/).

## Hash addon for Blender
The hash addon is my recreation of [GtkHash 1.2](https://github.com/tristanheaven/gtkhash). The source code is not based on GtkHash, though.

## Calculator addon for Blender
The calculator addon is some or less inspired by Gnome  Calculator but less functional. It just needs more love.
